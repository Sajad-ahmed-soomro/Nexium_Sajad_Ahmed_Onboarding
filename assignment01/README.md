> Based on ShadCN's prebuilt form components:

* `Form`, `FormField`, `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, `FormMessage`
* `Input` for topic search
* `Button` to trigger filtering
* Tailwind utility classes for styling
* Fallback `p` message and rendered `blockquote` quotes

---

## üí° Future Ideas

* Fetch quotes from public APIs
* Animate quote display using Framer Motion
* Store search history locally
